### **1. Blended Amine Systems**

Blended amine systems represent an evolutionary step, combining different classes of amines to create a solvent with synergistic properties. The primary goal is to merge the fast reaction kinetics of primary/secondary amines with the low regeneration energy and high capacity of tertiary or sterically hindered amines. These systems are among the most mature next-generation technologies.

#### **1.1. MDEA + Piperazine (PZ) Blends**

This blend is a leading candidate for replacing MEA. It leverages MDEA's low energy requirements and high capacity, while using PZ as a powerful rate promoter.

| **Parameter** | **Data and Analysis** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Chemical Composition** | Aqueous solution of N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA, a tertiary amine) and Piperazine (PZ, a cyclic secondary amine). A common formulation is 45 wt% MDEA + 5 wt% PZ. |
| **Novel Properties** | The blend creates a superior solvent where PZ acts as the primary reactant to quickly form carbamates, which then transfer the CO₂ to the MDEA, regenerating the PZ *in-situ* within the absorber. This shuttle mechanism overcomes MDEA's slow kinetics. |
| **Performance vs. MEA** | - **Absorption Rate:** Significantly faster than MDEA alone; an MDEA+PZ (5:1) blend has double the absorption rate of pure MDEA. Faster than MEA under certain conditions. <br> - **CO₂ Capacity:** Higher cyclic capacity. Achieves ~0.75 moles CO₂/kg solution, compared to ~0.5 for MEA. <br> - **Regeneration Energy:** Substantially lower. Increasing PZ from 5% to 20% in MDEA can reduce reboiler duty from 3.6 to **3.22 MJ/kg CO₂**. This is a marked improvement over MEA's typical >3.7 GJ/t-CO₂. |
| **Operational** | - **Stability:** Superior thermal and oxidative degradation resistance compared to MEA or MDEA alone. The degradation resistance order is: MDEA/PZ > MDEA > PZ. <br> - **Corrosion:** Significantly less corrosive than MEA, allowing for higher amine concentrations and the use of less expensive materials of construction. |
| **Environmental** | Lower volatility compared to MEA reduces fugitive emissions. More stable formulation leads to fewer harmful degradation byproducts. |
| **Economic** | The reduction in regeneration energy directly lowers operational expenditure (OPEX). Lower corrosion reduces maintenance costs. |
| **Technology Readiness** | **TRL 7-9**. MDEA/PZ blends are commercially available and have been deployed in multiple industrial facilities. They are considered a mature, bankable technology. |

#### **1.2. MEA + Piperazine (PZ) Blends**

Blending MEA with PZ aims to boost the performance of the conventional MEA solvent, primarily by increasing the absorption rate and capacity.

| **Parameter** | **Data and Analysis** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Chemical Composition** | Aqueous solution of Monoethanolamine (MEA, a primary amine) and Piperazine (PZ). |
| **Novel Properties** | PZ's high reaction rate constant (53,700 m³/s·kmol at 25 °C) serves as a potent activator, significantly accelerating the overall CO₂ absorption kinetics of the MEA solution. |
| **Performance vs. MEA** | - **Absorption Rate:** Higher absorption rate than 30 wt% MEA. For example, a 10 wt% MEA / 20 wt% PZ blend outperforms 30 wt% MEA. <br> - **Regeneration Energy:** Potentially higher than advanced blends. One study reported a range of **3.39 to 8.45 GJ/t-CO₂**, indicating that while absorption is improved, regeneration may not be as efficient as in MDEA-based systems. |
| **Operational** | Improved performance may allow for smaller absorber columns, reducing capital costs. However, it still largely shares MEA's challenges with corrosion and degradation. |
| **Environmental** | Shares similar environmental concerns as MEA, including the potential formation of nitrosamines from PZ (a secondary amine) and other degradation products. |
| **Economic** | The economic case depends on the trade-off between improved absorption (potentially lower CAPEX) and the regeneration energy penalty (OPEX). |
| **Technology Readiness** | **TRL 6-8**. Well-studied at pilot scale and understood, but less commonly deployed commercially than MDEA/PZ blends, which offer more significant energy advantages. |

#### **1.3. Multi-Component Blends**

These advanced formulations mix three or more components to fine-tune solvent properties for specific applications, representing the frontier of amine blending.

| **Parameter** | **Data and Analysis** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Chemical Composition** | Varies widely. Examples include: <br> - **MEA + 1DMA2P + PZ:** A trio-amine blend. <br> - **TETA + PZ + MDEA:** A tri-blend combining a secondary amine, an activator, and a tertiary amine. <br> - **MEA + BEA + AMP:** A blend of a primary, a secondary, and a sterically hindered amine. |
| **Novel Properties** | These blends are highly engineered to balance reaction kinetics, capacity, viscosity, and regeneration energy. For instance, a sterically hindered amine (like AMP) can be added to reduce the heat of reaction while an activator (like PZ) boosts kinetics. |
| **Performance vs. MEA** | - **Capacity:** Trio-amine blends (MEA/1DMA2P/PZ) can increase cyclic capacity by **40-120%** over 5M MEA. <br> - **Regeneration Energy:** Significant reductions are possible. The MEA/1DMA2P/PZ blend reduced energy consumption by **29.4-55.4%**. The MEA-BEA-AMP system achieved a very low heat duty of **2.4 GJ/tCO₂** at pilot scale. |
| **Economic** | A techno-economic analysis showed a tri-blend (5% TETA + 5% PZ + 20% MDEA) could achieve a capture cost **27.33% lower than MEA**. This highlights the significant economic potential of optimized blends. |
| **Technology Readiness** | **TRL 4-7**. Many are at the pilot plant stage. Some proprietary commercial solvents (e.g., MHI's KS-21™, a hindered amine blend) fall into this category and have reached TRL 9, demonstrating a clear pathway to market. |

### **2. Advanced Solvent Classes**

This category includes solvents with fundamentally different chemistries than aqueous amines, offering unique mechanisms for CO₂ capture and regeneration. They are generally at a lower TRL but promise transformative performance improvements.

#### **2.1. Ionic Liquids (ILs) & Amino Acid Ionic Liquids (AAILs)**

ILs are organic salts that are liquid below 100°C. Their key advantage is their negligible vapor pressure and high "tunability," allowing their chemical and physical properties to be designed for specific tasks.

| **Parameter** | **Data and Analysis** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Chemical Composition** | Composed of a large organic cation and an organic or inorganic anion. AAILs incorporate amino acid anions, blending the properties of ILs and Amino Acid Salts. |
| **Novel Properties** | - **Negligible Vapor Pressure:** Virtually no solvent loss to the atmosphere, eliminating a major source of emissions and operational cost. <br> - **Tunability:** Cations and anions can be modified to optimize CO₂ solubility, viscosity, and reactivity. CO₂ capture can occur via physisorption or chemisorption. <br> - **High Thermal Stability:** Generally more stable than amines at high temperatures. |
| **Performance vs. MEA** | Can be designed for high CO₂ capacity. Dual-functional ILs (DFILs) have been shown to potentially reduce absorption process costs by **25-35%** compared to MEA. |
| **Challenges** | - **High Viscosity:** Can lead to poor mass transfer kinetics. <br> - **High Cost:** Synthesis is complex and expensive, a major barrier to large-scale deployment. <br> - **Toxicity:** While often touted as "green," the toxicity of many ILs is not well-characterized and can be significant. |
| **Technology Readiness** | **TRL 2-4**. Primarily at the laboratory and early-stage research phase. Cost and viscosity remain major hurdles for industrial scale-up. |

#### **2.2. Phase-Change / Biphasic Solvents**

These solvents undergo a phase separation upon CO₂ absorption or desorption. Typically, a CO₂-rich phase separates from a CO₂-lean phase, meaning only the small, rich phase needs to be heated for regeneration, dramatically reducing the energy duty.

> 
> **Figure 1:** General process flow for a biphasic solvent. Only the CO₂-rich phase is sent to the stripper, minimizing the regeneration volume.

| **Parameter** | **Data and Analysis** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Chemical Composition** | Often a blend of an amine and a non-polar co-solvent (e.g., an alcohol). Example: **MEA / 1-propanol**. A novel example is glyoxal-bis(iminoguanidine) (GBIG). |
| **Novel Properties** | The liquid-liquid phase separation is the key innovation. This drastically reduces the parasitic energy load, as the bulk of the solvent is recycled directly to the absorber without being heated. |
| **Performance vs. MEA** | - **Regeneration Energy:** Can be exceptionally low. The MEA/1-propanol absorbent reported a regeneration heat of **2.40 GJ/t-CO₂**, a significant improvement over MEA's >3.7 GJ/t-CO₂. |
| **Challenges** | Managing the phase separation, ensuring complete separation, and handling potential solvent crossover between phases can be operationally complex. |
| **Technology Readiness** | **TRL 3-5**. The concept is well-proven in laboratories and is moving towards pilot-scale demonstration. Significant potential if operational complexities can be managed at scale. |

#### **2.3. Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES)**

DES are mixtures of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors (e.g., choline chloride and urea) that form a eutectic with a melting point far lower than the individual components. They are often considered a cheaper, more environmentally friendly analogue to Ionic Liquids.

| **Parameter** | **Data and Analysis** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Chemical Composition** | A mixture of at least two components, a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and a hydrogen bond donor (HBD). Example: Camphor and Menthol (CAM:MEN). |
| **Novel Properties** | - **Low Cost & Easy Synthesis:** Components are often cheap, readily available, and can be mixed without complex synthesis. <br> - **Biodegradability & Low Toxicity:** Many DES are based on natural, biodegradable compounds. <br> - **Low Vapor Pressure:** Similar to ILs, they have very low volatility. |
| **Performance vs. MEA** | Capture is typically via physisorption. A camphor:menthol DES showed a low enthalpy of absorption (**-14.7 kJ/mol**), suggesting easy regeneration. However, their CO₂ absorption capacity is often lower than chemisorption-based amine solvents. |
| **Challenges** | - **High Viscosity:** A major issue, similar to ILs, hindering mass transfer. <br> - **Lower Capacity:** Physisorption generally leads to lower CO₂ loading compared to the chemical reactions in amine solvents. |
| **Technology Readiness** | **TRL 2-4**. An active area of academic research, but significant development is needed to address viscosity and capacity limitations for industrial use. |

### **3. Emerging Solvent Technologies**

These concepts are at the earliest stages of research (TRL 1-3) and represent frontier areas that could lead to breakthrough performance. Data is often limited to theoretical models and lab-scale experiments.

| Technology | Concept and Potential | Key Challenges |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enzyme-Enhanced Solvents** | Utilizes the enzyme **carbonic anhydrase** to dramatically accelerate the hydration of CO₂ in benign solvents like potassium carbonate. This mimics the biological process of CO₂ transport in blood. Potential for very high reaction rates with low-energy regeneration. | Enzyme stability in industrial conditions (temperature, contaminants) is a major concern. Cost of the enzyme is also a factor. (Data not available in referenced literature). |
| **Nano-fluid Solvents** | Involves dispersing nanoparticles (e.g., silica, metal oxides) into a base solvent (like water or an amine). The nanoparticles are intended to increase the surface area for mass transfer and potentially enhance thermal properties to improve heat exchange efficiency. | Ensuring long-term stability of the nanoparticle suspension (preventing agglomeration) and understanding the precise mechanism of enhancement are key research questions. |
| **Bio-based Solvents** | A broad category focused on developing solvents derived from renewable biomass sources. This includes solvents like amino acid salts (AASs), some deep eutectic solvents, and others. The primary driver is sustainability and reducing the carbon footprint of the solvent itself. | Performance must be competitive with fossil-derived solvents. Scaling up production from biomass can be challenging and costly. |
| **Switchable Solvents** | Solvents that can be "switched" between two forms with different properties (e.g., polar/non-polar, miscible/immiscible) using a trigger like the introduction/removal of CO₂. This allows for energy-efficient product separation or regeneration. Phase-change solvents are a type of switchable solvent. | The chemistry is often complex, and ensuring high reversibility over many cycles is a significant challenge. The concept is largely at the proof-of-concept stage. |
