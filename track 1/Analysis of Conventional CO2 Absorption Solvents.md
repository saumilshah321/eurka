## **1. Secondary Amines**

Secondary amines, such as Diethanolamine (DEA) and Diisopropanolamine (DIPA), react with CO₂ via the carbamate formation mechanism, similar to primary amines. They generally exhibit fast reaction kinetics but are associated with higher regeneration energy demands compared to tertiary amines. Their structure, containing one hydrogen atom on the amine nitrogen, also makes them precursors to carcinogenic nitrosamines upon degradation.

### **Solvent Profile: Diethanolamine (DEA)**

Diethanolamine (DEA) is a secondary amine that serves as a common alternative to MEA. It offers a balance of reactivity and lower volatility but shares some of the same fundamental drawbacks, including high regeneration energy and potential for corrosive action.

## **2. Tertiary Amines**

Tertiary amines, such as MDEA and TEA, represent a significant evolution in solvent chemistry for CO₂ capture. They do not have a hydrogen atom on the nitrogen and therefore cannot form stable carbamates. Instead, they act as a base to catalyze the hydration of CO₂, forming bicarbonate. This mechanism leads to a higher theoretical CO₂ loading capacity and, crucially, a lower heat of reaction, which translates into substantially lower regeneration energy requirements. The trade-off is a generally slower rate of CO₂ absorption.

### **Solvent Profile: N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA)**

MDEA is the most widely used tertiary amine, valued for its high CO₂ loading capacity, low regeneration energy, and superior chemical stability compared to primary and secondary amines. Its main drawback, a slow reaction rate, is often overcome by using it in blended solvent systems.

#### **Chemical and Physical Properties**

| Property | Value / Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Chemical Formula** | C₅H₁₃NO₂ |
| **IUPAC Name** | 2,2'-(Methylimino)di(ethan-1-ol) |
| **Molecular Weight** | 119.16 g/mol |
| **Structure** | A tertiary amine with one methyl group and two ethanol groups attached to the nitrogen atom. |
| | ![Chemical structure of MDEA](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Methyldiethanolamine.svg/320px-Methyldiethanolamine.svg.png) |
| **Physical Properties** | Specific values for *density, viscosity, surface tension, vapor pressure, thermal conductivity,* and *heat capacity* were not available in the referenced literature. |

#### **CO₂ Absorption and Reaction Kinetics**

> The "base-catalyzed hydration mechanism" of tertiary amines allows for a higher theoretical CO₂ loading capacity and often greater CO₂ solubility in the solution.

*   **Absorption Rate:** MDEA has a **slower intrinsic CO₂ absorption rate** than primary and secondary amines. This is its primary limitation, which can be effectively mitigated by blending with activators like piperazine (PZ). An MDEA + PZ (5:1) blend was shown to **double the absorption rate** compared to pure MDEA.
*   **CO₂ Loading Capacity:** The bicarbonate reaction mechanism allows for a theoretical capacity of **1.0 mole of CO₂ per mole of MDEA**. MDEA/PZ blends can achieve an operational capacity of approximately **0.75 moles CO₂/kg amine+water**, higher than the 0.5 for MEA.
*   **Reaction Kinetics Data:** The pKa value is a critical parameter for tertiary amines in determining their suitability. Specific quantitative kinetic data were not provided.

#### **Regeneration and Desorption Characteristics**

MDEA's primary advantage lies in its low energy requirement for regeneration.

*   **Regeneration Energy:** The reaction of CO₂ with MDEA is less exothermic, making it easier to regenerate.
    *   **MEA/MDEA Blends:** Can reduce energy consumption by over **30%** compared to a pristine MEA system.
    *   **MDEA/PZ Blends:** Increasing PZ content from 5% to 20% in an MDEA solution was shown to reduce reboiler duty from **3.6 to 3.22 MJ/kg CO₂**.
*   **Heat of Absorption:** MDEA is characterized by a **low heat of reaction**, which is the fundamental reason for its lower regeneration energy demand.

#### **Operational Considerations**

*   **Stability and Degradation:** MDEA exhibits **higher thermal and oxidative stability** and lower degradation rates compared to MEA. MDEA/PZ blends are particularly resistant to degradation under typical absorption/stripping conditions.
*   **Corrosion:** MDEA solutions are significantly **less corrosive** than MEA solutions, reducing capital and maintenance costs for plant equipment.

#### **Environmental and Safety Profile**

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Degradation Products** | More resistant to degradation than MEA. In blends, PZ degradation is the dominant pathway, but MDEA's presence can influence byproduct formation. |
| **Ecotoxicity** | Toxicity potentials for MDEA have been quantified, but the data is subject to considerable uncertainty. Its lower volatility compared to MEA reduces atmospheric emissions. |
| **Health & Safety Hazards** | General amine handling precautions apply. Its lower volatility presents a reduced inhalation risk compared to more volatile amines. |

#### **Economic Data**
MDEA is a key component in strategies to lower the cost of CO₂ capture.
*   **Overall Capture Cost:** A techno-economic assessment of a tri-blend solvent (5% TETA + 5% PZ + 20% MDEA) indicated a CO₂ capture cost **27.33% lower** than an industrial MEA process. The lower energy consumption for desorption is a primary driver of reduced operational expenditure.

| **Physical Properties** | Specific values were not available in the referenced literature. |

#### **Performance and Operational Characteristics**

Based on its classification as a tertiary amine, TEA is expected to have the following characteristics:
*   **Absorption Rate:** Slower than primary and secondary amines.
*   **CO₂ Loading Capacity:** A higher theoretical capacity (approaching 1:1 molar ratio) compared to MEA.
*   **Regeneration Energy:** Lower regeneration energy due to the bicarbonate formation mechanism and a lower heat of reaction.
*   **Stability and Corrosion:** Higher stability and lower corrosivity compared to MEA.

#### **Environmental and Safety Profile**

*   **Ecotoxicity:** The literature mentions that toxicity potentials have been quantified for TEA, but these figures are subject to considerable uncertainty.

#### **Economic Data**

Specific economic data for TEA were not provided. Its viability would depend on balancing its low regeneration energy against its slow absorption kinetics, which might necessitate larger equipment or the use of activators.

## **3. Sterically Hindered Amines**

Sterically hindered amines are amines where bulky alkyl groups are attached to the carbon atom adjacent to the amino group. This structural feature inhibits the formation of stable carbamates, forcing the reaction to proceed primarily through the formation of bicarbonate, similar to tertiary amines. This unique characteristic combines the high loading capacity and low regeneration energy of tertiary amines with the presence of a reactive N-H bond found in primary or secondary amines.

### **Solvent Profile: 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP)**

AMP is the most well-known sterically hindered primary amine. Its molecular structure provides a unique combination of reactivity and favorable thermodynamics, making it an attractive alternative to conventional amines.

| Property | Value / Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Chemical Formula** | C₄H₁₁NO |
| **IUPAC Name** | 2-Amino-2-methylpropan-1-ol |
| **Molecular Weight** | 89.14 g/mol |
| **Structure** | A primary amine where the amino group is attached to a tertiary carbon, creating steric hindrance. |
| | ![Chemical structure of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/2-Amino-2-methyl-1-propanol.svg/320px-2-Amino-2-methyl-1-propanol.svg.png) |
| **Physical Properties** | Specific values were not available in the referenced literature. |

#### **CO₂ Absorption and Reaction Kinetics**

> "The steric bulk around the nitrogen atom in AMP hinders the formation of stable carbamates... Instead, AMP predominantly reacts with CO₂ to form bicarbonate ions and protonated amines."

*   **Absorption Rate:** AMP has a **slower reaction rate** compared to MEA. This can be addressed by blending with activators like piperazine (PZ).
*   **CO₂ Loading Capacity:** Due to the bicarbonate pathway, AMP can theoretically achieve a loading capacity of up to **1.0 mole of CO₂ per mole of amine**, double that of MEA. A 10 wt% AMP / 20 wt% PZ blend recorded the highest CO₂ absorption capacity in one comparative study.
*   **Reaction Kinetics Data:** Quantitative kinetic data were not provided in the source material.

#### **Regeneration and Desorption Characteristics**

The reduced stability of the AMP-carbamate intermediate is the key to its excellent regeneration performance.

*   **Regeneration Energy:** AMP-based processes have significantly lower energy requirements.
    *   Studies report that AMP can achieve **25.6% lower reboiler duty** than MEA-based processes.
    *   A pilot-scale trisolvent system of **MEA–BEA–AMP** reported a heat duty as low as **2.4 GJ/tCO₂**.
*   **Regeneration Conditions:** The lower energy requirement allows for regeneration at higher temperatures and pressures, further contributing to process efficiency.

#### **Operational Considerations**

*   **Stability:** AMP exhibits **better chemical and thermal stability** with lower degradation rates compared to MEA, which is advantageous for long-term industrial operation.
*   **Blending:** AMP is often used in blends to balance its low regeneration energy with the faster kinetics of other amines. However, MEA/AMP blends can have lower overall rates than 30 wt% MEA alone.

#### **Environmental and Safety Profile**

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Degradation Products** | Its higher stability reduces the rate of degradation and formation of byproducts compared to MEA. |
| **Ecotoxicity** | Toxicity potentials for AMP have been quantified, but like other amines, this data is subject to uncertainty. |
| **Health & Safety Hazards** | General amine handling precautions apply. |

#### **Economic Data**

The primary economic advantage of AMP is the significant reduction in operational costs due to lower regeneration energy. This can offset potentially higher initial solvent costs and make it a highly competitive option for large-scale capture projects.
