#### **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis**

TCO extends beyond the initial solvent price, encompassing capital (CAPEX) and operational (OPEX) expenditures. Analysis of large-scale projects reveals that regeneration energy and plant availability are the most critical factors determining economic feasibility.

**Comparative Cost of CO₂ Capture (€/tonne CO₂)**

| Solvent / Technology | Estimated Capture Cost (€/tonne CO₂) | Key Cost Drivers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MEA (Benchmark)** | €51 - €156 | **High OPEX:** Dominated by high regeneration energy (>3.7 GJ/tCO₂). High solvent degradation/makeup costs ($0.20 - $1.30/tCO₂) and corrosion also contribute. |
| **Advanced Amine Blends (e.g., MDEA/PZ)** | €31 - €77 | **Lower OPEX:** Regeneration energy is significantly reduced (~3.2 GJ/tCO₂), leading to annualized cost reductions of 7-27% vs. MEA. Lower corrosion allows for higher amine concentrations, potentially reducing CAPEX (smaller equipment). |
| **Ionic Liquids (ILs)** | €81 - €90 | **High CAPEX / Solvent Cost:** While OPEX can be lower due to reduced energy needs, high initial solvent cost and potentially higher equipment costs (due to viscosity) drive up the total cost. A 50 €/kg solvent price can add ~5% to the total annualized cost. |
| **Real-World Project Costs** | | |
| *Boundary Dam* | High ($140/MWh electricity) | **CAPEX Overruns:** Project cost of ~$1.5B CAD. <br> **Low Availability:** Failure to meet capture targets led to revenue loss and penalties, rendering it uneconomical for expansion. |
| *Petra Nova* | High (Needed ~$75/bbl oil) | **Commodity Price Dependency:** Economic model was fragile and failed when oil prices collapsed. <br> **Downtime:** Significant downtime (1 in 3 days) also impacted economics. |

> **Strategic Conclusion:** The evidence strongly indicates that while MEA is cheap to purchase, its high energy penalty makes it expensive to operate. Advanced amine blends, particularly those based on MDEA/PZ, offer the most compelling business case today. They provide a tangible reduction in OPEX without the prohibitive cost and technological risk associated with more nascent technologies like ionic liquids. **Investing in evolutionary, not revolutionary, solvent technology presents the most prudent path to cost-competitive carbon capture in the near term.**
