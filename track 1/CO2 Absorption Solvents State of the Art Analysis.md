# **State-of-the-Art Analysis of CO₂ Absorption Solvents for Industrial Gas Treatment**

## **1. Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current landscape of CO₂ absorption solvents for industrial gas treatment. Synthesizing data from industrial projects, pilot plant campaigns, and academic literature, it evaluates solvents based on performance, cost, and technological maturity. The findings indicate a clear industry trajectory away from the benchmark Monoethanolamine (MEA) towards advanced amine blends and next-generation systems that offer significant reductions in the primary cost driver: regeneration energy.

A critical finding is the persistent gap between design specifications and real-world operational performance. Major commercial projects like Boundary Dam and Petra Nova have been plagued by significant downtime, not always related to the capture island itself, which severely impacts economic viability. This underscores that plant availability and system-wide reliability are as crucial as solvent efficiency.

While MEA remains a low-cost, well-understood benchmark, its high energy penalty (>3.7 GJ/tonne CO₂), corrosive nature, and tendency to form hazardous degradation products render it economically and environmentally suboptimal for future large-scale deployments. The most promising near-term alternatives are advanced, proprietary amine blends that are commercially mature and offer a compelling balance of improved efficiency, lower energy consumption, and manageable operational risk.

### **Performance Ranking of Promising Solvents**

The following table ranks the top five most promising solvent systems, evaluated on a composite of regeneration energy, CO₂ capacity, corrosion profile, and Technology Readiness Level (TRL). This ranking highlights technologies that offer the most viable pathways to cost-effective, large-scale carbon capture.

| Rank | Solvent System | Technology Class | Key Justification & Performance Metrics | TRL |

### **Critical Research Gaps and Uncertainties**

The validation analysis of the source data reveals several critical areas of uncertainty that inhibit confident investment and deployment decisions for next-generation technologies:

1.  **Lack of Quantitative Corrosion Data:** For most advanced solvents, corrosion characteristics are described only qualitatively ("low," "moderate"). There is a significant lack of quantitative data (e.g., mm/year) under realistic flue gas conditions containing impurities like SOx and NOx. This is a major barrier to predicting plant lifetime and maintenance costs.
2.  **Long-Term Stability of Novel Solvents:** Emerging technologies like Ionic Liquids (ILs), Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES), and Phase-Change Solvents lack long-duration testing. Data on their degradation pathways, makeup rates, and stability over thousands of hours in an industrial environment is non-existent, representing a major risk for scale-up.
3.  **Standardized Performance Reporting:** The absence of a universal standard for reporting key metrics makes direct, "apples-to-apples" comparisons difficult. Metrics like CO₂ loading and regeneration energy are often reported under different units or process conditions, creating ambiguity.

### **Industry Implementation Status**

The review of large-scale industrial projects reveals a consistent theme: advanced solvents (e.g., MHI KS-1™, Shell CANSOLV™) successfully achieve their designed capture efficiencies (>90%) when the plant is operational. However, the overall success and economic viability of these projects have been severely hampered by issues external to solvent chemistry:

*   **Systemic Unreliability:** Projects like Boundary Dam and Petra Nova experienced extensive downtime (30-50% in some periods), often due to failures in balance-of-plant equipment (compressors, host power plant), not the capture unit itself.
*   **Economic Vulnerability:** The economic models for early projects were often fragile, relying on volatile commodity prices (e.g., oil for EOR) or failing to account for the high cost of unreliability.

**Conclusion:** The industry has successfully proven that advanced solvents work at scale. The current challenge is not just discovering better solvents, but engineering and operating the *entire integrated system* with high reliability and managing the significant financial risks of these multi-billion dollar projects through stable, long-term policy support.

## **3. Detailed Analysis by Category**

### **Primary Amines: MEA Deep Dive**

Monoethanolamine (MEA) serves as the industry's historical benchmark. Its primary advantages are a fast CO₂ absorption rate, low purchase price, and a high degree of technological maturity. Typically used in 15-30 wt% aqueous solutions, it reacts with CO₂ via a carbamate formation mechanism.

> **Reaction Mechanism:** 2 RNH₂ + CO₂ ⇌ RNH₃⁺ + RNHCOO⁻

This reaction is rapid, but it imposes a stoichiometric limit of **0.5 moles of CO₂ per mole of amine**, limiting the solvent's carrying capacity. The MEA-carbamate bond is highly stable, which translates directly to a significant energy penalty for regeneration. Reported values range from **3.5 to 6.0 GJ/tonne CO₂** at pilot scale (TCM), with optimized systems benchmarked around 3.87 GJ/tonne CO₂. This regeneration energy is the single largest contributor to the high operational cost of MEA-based capture.

Operationally, MEA presents several challenges:
*   **Corrosion:** Aqueous MEA is highly corrosive, necessitating the use of expensive corrosion-resistant alloys or inhibitors, increasing both CAPEX and OPEX.
*   **Degradation:** MEA is susceptible to both thermal and oxidative degradation, especially in the presence of flue gas impurities (O₂, SOx, NOx). This leads to solvent losses (reported as 0.2 to 3.7 kg/tCO₂), the formation of hazardous waste, and operational problems like foaming.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Degradation produces harmful byproducts, including carcinogenic nitrosamines. The solvent's volatility also contributes to atmospheric emissions and ecotoxicity.

Despite these drawbacks, optimized MEA systems are still considered economically competitive in some analyses, with capture costs estimated between $37-39/tonne CO₂. However, the clear trend in the industry is to move towards solvents that directly address MEA's fundamental weaknesses.

**Figure 1: Absorption Capacity Comparison Chart (Theoretical)**
A comparison of the theoretical molar loading capacity for different amine classes.

```
          Solvent Class | Theoretical Capacity (mol CO₂/mol Amine)
------------------------|------------------------------------------------
Primary/Secondary (MEA) | 0.5  [██████████                    ]
Tertiary/Hindered (MDEA/AMP) | 1.0  [████████████████████          ]
Piperazine (as activator) | 1.0  [████████████████████          ]
```

### **Secondary and Tertiary Amines: A Comparative Analysis**

**Secondary Amines (DEA, DIPA)**
Secondary amines like Diethanolamine (DEA) and Diisopropanolamine (DIPA) also react via the carbamate mechanism, offering fast absorption kinetics similar to MEA. However, they share the same fundamental limitations: a low theoretical capacity (0.5 mol/mol) and a high heat of absorption, leading to high regeneration energy. Their primary operational drawback is their propensity to form stable, carcinogenic nitrosamines, a significant environmental and health concern that has pushed development towards other amine classes.

**Tertiary Amines (MDEA, TEA)**
Tertiary amines, such as N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), represent a significant improvement. Lacking a hydrogen on the amine nitrogen, they cannot form carbamates. Instead, they act as a base to catalyze the hydration of CO₂ into bicarbonate.

> **Reaction Mechanism:** R₃N + H₂O + CO₂ ⇌ R₃NH⁺ + HCO₃⁻

This mechanism offers two transformative advantages:
1.  **High Capacity:** The theoretical CO₂ loading is doubled to **1.0 mole of CO₂ per mole of amine**.
2.  **Low Regeneration Energy:** The heat of reaction is much lower, substantially reducing the energy required to reverse the reaction in the stripper. MDEA-based systems can reduce energy consumption by over 30% compared to MEA.

The primary trade-off is a **slower intrinsic reaction rate**. This limitation is almost always overcome in practice by blending MDEA with a small amount of a kinetic promoter or "activator," like piperazine (PZ). An MDEA/PZ blend can double the absorption rate of MDEA alone while retaining its favorable thermodynamics. Furthermore, MDEA is significantly less corrosive and more chemically stable than MEA, reducing operational costs and improving plant longevity.

### **Sterically Hindered Amines: Performance and Potential**

Sterically hindered amines, with 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) as the archetype, offer the "best of both worlds." They are primary or secondary amines, but bulky alkyl groups near the amino group destabilize the carbamate that forms upon reaction with CO₂. This structural hindrance forces the reaction to proceed primarily via the bicarbonate mechanism, similar to tertiary amines.

This confers the dual benefit of **high loading capacity (1.0 mol/mol)** and **low regeneration energy**. Studies report that AMP-based processes can achieve a **25.6% lower reboiler duty** than MEA. Like tertiary amines, AMP's intrinsic reaction rate is slower than MEA's, making it an ideal candidate for blending with activators like piperazine. The resulting **AMP/PZ blend (known as CESAR-1)** is one of the most promising next-generation solvents, demonstrating regeneration energies as low as **2.6 GJ/tonne CO₂** in pilot campaigns.

### **Blended Amine Systems: Synergies and Optimization**

Blended amine systems are the most mature and commercially successful next-generation technology. The strategy is to combine amines from different classes to create a solvent with synergistic properties that outperform any single component.

*   **MDEA + Piperazine (PZ):** This is the leading commercial blend. It combines MDEA's high capacity and low regeneration energy with PZ's powerful kinetic promotion. PZ acts as a shuttle, rapidly absorbing CO₂ and transferring it to the MDEA within the absorber. This system is at **TRL 7-9**, offering very low corrosion, superior stability, and a regeneration energy of **3.2 - 3.6 GJ/tonne CO₂**.
*   **Multi-Component Blends:** The frontier of amine blending involves complex, proprietary mixtures of three or more components to fine-tune properties. A pilot-scale blend of **MEA–BEA–AMP** achieved a remarkable heat duty of **2.4 GJ/tCO₂**. A techno-economic analysis of another tri-blend (TETA + PZ + MDEA) predicted a capture cost **27.33% lower than MEA**. These highly engineered solvents, such as MHI's commercial **KS-1™** and **KS-21™**, represent the state-of-the-art in deployed technology.

### **Advanced Solvents: The Next Generation (Ionic Liquids, Biphasic, DES, etc.)**

These solvents, mostly at lower TRLs (2-5), employ fundamentally different chemistries to overcome the limitations of aqueous amines.

*   **Phase-Change / Biphasic Solvents:** These are arguably the most promising near-term advanced solvents. Upon CO₂ absorption, the solvent separates into a small, CO₂-rich liquid phase and a large, CO₂-lean phase. Only the rich phase is pumped to the stripper and heated for regeneration. This dramatically reduces the volume of liquid being heated, with the potential for exceptionally low regeneration energy. An MEA/1-propanol blend demonstrated a heat requirement of only **2.40 GJ/tonne CO₂**. The main challenge is managing the operational complexity of the phase separation at scale.

*   **Ionic Liquids (ILs):** These are organic salts that are liquid at low temperatures. Their key advantage is a **negligible vapor pressure**, which eliminates solvent loss to the atmosphere. Their properties are highly "tunable," but they currently face major barriers of **high viscosity** (which impedes mass transfer) and **prohibitively high cost**, restricting them to lab-scale research (TRL 2-4).

*   **Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES):** Often considered cheaper, more biodegradable analogues to ILs, DES are mixtures of common compounds (e.g., choline chloride and urea). They share the advantage of low volatility but also suffer from high viscosity. Their absorption capacity is often lower than amines as they typically rely on weaker physisorption mechanisms. They remain at an early research stage (TRL 2-4).

**Figure 2: Regeneration Energy vs. Performance Plot**

This conceptual plot illustrates the strategic goal of solvent development: moving from the upper-left quadrant (high energy, low capacity) to the lower-right quadrant (low energy, high capacity).

> The plot would show **MEA** in the upper-left (high energy, ~0.5 mol/mol capacity). **MDEA and AMP** would be lower on the energy axis but further right on the capacity axis (~1.0 mol/mol). The most advanced systems like **Phase-Change Solvents** and optimized **Multi-Component Blends** would occupy the most desirable position in the lower-right, demonstrating both very low regeneration energy (<2.5 GJ/tonne) and high effective working capacity.

## **4. Industrial Implementation Review**

### **High-Level Project Comparison**

| Project | Location | Type | Operational Status | Key Solvent Technology | Stated Regeneration Energy (GJ/tonne CO₂) | Target Capture Efficiency (%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sleipner** | Offshore Norway | Gas Processing | Operational (since 1996) | Amine (MEA/MDEA) | Not Applicable | Reduces CO₂ from 9% to <2.5% |
| **Boundary Dam** | Saskatchewan, Canada | Commercial | Operational (since 2014) | Shell CANSOLV | Not specified (claimed "low") | 90% |
| **Petra Nova** | Texas, USA | Commercial | Operational (Restarted 2023) | MHI KS-1 | 2.94 | 90% |
| **TCM** | Mongstad, Norway | Pilot Plant | Operational (since 2012) | Various (MEA, CANSOLV, CESAR-1, etc.) | MEA: 3.5-6.0, CESAR-1: 3.4-3.5 | Varies (up to 99%) |
| **CESAR** | EU Pilot Tests | R&D Project | Completed (2008-2011) | AMP / Piperazine (CESAR1) | ~2.6 (with optimization) | ≥90% |
| **CASTOR** | EU Pilot Tests | R&D Project | Completed (2004-2008) | "CASTOR-2" | ~3.2 (with integration) | 90% |

### **1. Sleipner CO₂ Injection Project**
As the world's first industrial offshore CCS project, Sleipner separates CO₂ from a natural gas stream to meet product specifications. It remains a cornerstone for understanding long-term geological storage. The project was economically driven by Norway's CO₂ tax, demonstrating that strong policy is a powerful catalyst for CCS. Its key lesson is the critical importance of robust monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems, highlighted by initial difficulties in tracking the subsurface plume and a multi-year period of over-reporting capture volumes due to faulty equipment.

### **2. Boundary Dam CCS Project**
Boundary Dam was the world's first commercial-scale, post-combustion CCS facility on a coal-fired power plant. Its operational history provides a crucial, cautionary tale. While the Shell CANSOLV™ solvent achieved its target capture efficiency of ~89% *when online*, the facility's overall performance was crippled by poor availability. Frequent downtime resulted in an average capture rate of only ~57% of the design target. This highlights that **plant reliability and system integration are paramount for success**, and that headline efficiency numbers are meaningless without high availability. The project was deemed economically non-viable for expansion.

### **3. Petra Nova CCS Project**
Attached to a large coal plant, Petra Nova successfully demonstrated the high-performance MHI KS-1™ solvent, achieving >92.4% capture efficiency with a low regeneration energy of **2.94 GJ/tonne CO₂**. However, like Boundary Dam, it suffered from extensive downtime (367 days in its first three years), not just from the capture island but also from the host plant and CO₂ pipeline. Its economics were critically tied to high oil prices for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and the project was mothballed in 2020 when oil prices collapsed. Its 2023 restart, supported by enhanced 45Q tax credits, proves that stable, long-term financial incentives are essential to de-risk these capital-intensive projects from commodity market volatility.

### **4. Technology Centre Mongstad (TCM)**
TCM is the world's premier open-access test facility for qualifying and de-risking carbon capture technologies. It serves as an indispensable bridge from lab to industry, testing a wide array of solvents (including MEA, CESAR-1, and proprietary systems from Shell, MHI, and Aker) on real flue gas. It provides crucial data on performance, degradation, emissions, and corrosion, helping technology developers prove their systems before attempting commercial scale-up. Work at TCM has validated the lower energy requirements of advanced solvents like CESAR-1 (~3.4 GJ/t) compared to the MEA benchmark (3.5-6.0 GJ/t).

### **5. CESAR & 6. CASTOR Projects**
These foundational European R&D projects were instrumental in developing and validating the science behind advanced blended amine solvents. CASTOR developed early formulations achieving ~3.2 GJ/tonne, a major improvement at the time. Its successor, CESAR, focused on the **AMP/PZ blend (CESAR-1)**, proving it could reach efficiencies up to 99% and regeneration energies as low as **~2.6 GJ/tonne** with advanced process integration. These projects successfully demonstrated the technological pathways to significant cost reduction and paved the way for the advanced solvents used in commercial plants today.

**Figure 3: Temperature Dependency Curves**

> For chemisorption solvents like **MEA and MDEA+PZ**, CO₂ loading is highly sensitive to temperature. At low temperatures in the absorber (e.g., 40-60°C), equilibrium favors the formation of carbamate/bicarbonate, leading to high CO₂ loading. As the temperature increases in the stripper (e.g., 100-120°C), the reaction equilibrium shifts, favoring the release of CO₂ and resulting in very low loading in the lean solvent. This temperature swing is the fundamental principle of the process. For physisorption solvents like some **Ionic Liquids**, the relationship is similar but governed by Henry's Law: CO₂ solubility is higher at lower temperatures and decreases as temperature rises, allowing for regeneration, often with a smaller temperature or pressure swing than required for amines.

## **5. Innovation and Future Trends**

### **Emerging Solvent Technologies (2023-2025 Developments)**

The innovation landscape is advancing beyond conventional amines, with several new technologies showing significant promise and moving up the TRL scale.

| **Water-Lean Solvents** | Formulations with minimal or no water to eliminate the parasitic energy load of heating water. | **EEMPA (PNNL, 2021):** A water-lean solvent demonstrated a 19% cost reduction and 17% lower energy use compared to commercial tech. | 4-6 |
| **Advanced Porous Materials** | **MOFs (Metal-Organic Frameworks) & COFs (Covalent Organic Frameworks):** "Molecular sponges" with ultra-high surface areas for selective CO₂ adsorption. | - **ZnH-MFU-4_l (UC Berkeley):** Captures CO₂ from hot flue gas (>300°C) with >90% efficiency. <br> - A novel MOF filter showed 19% lower cost and 17% less energy vs. amines. | 3-5 |
| **Bio-based Solvents** | Derived from renewable biomass, offering a "green" and sustainable alternative to fossil-derived amines. | **Furatech™ 1 & 2 (Circa Group, 2023):** New patents filed for non-toxic solvents derived from levoglucosenone (LGO), showing good capture performance and lower regeneration energy. | 3-5 |

### **Key Research and Development Priorities**

Analysis of recent trends reveals a clear consensus on the strategic priorities for solvent R&D:
1.  **Reduce Regeneration Energy:** This remains the paramount goal, as it is the largest component of OPEX. All leading innovations, from water-lean solvents to phase-change systems, are aimed at this target.
2.  **Improve Solvent Stability:** Minimizing thermal and oxidative degradation is critical for reducing solvent makeup costs, mitigating corrosion, and lowering the expense of waste disposal.
3.  **Increase CO₂ Loading Capacity:** A higher working capacity reduces the solvent circulation rate, allowing for smaller pumps, pipes, and heat exchangers, thus directly lowering CAPEX.
4.  **Develop "Green" Solvents:** There is a strong push towards solvents with superior environmental profiles: low toxicity, biodegradability, and low volatility to minimize fugitive emissions.

### **Market Evolution Predictions and Economic Drivers**

The CO₂ capture solvent market, valued at **USD 259.6 million in 2024**, is projected to grow at a CAGR of ~6% through 2030. This growth is almost entirely dependent on supportive policy frameworks like carbon taxes and tax credits (e.g., the U.S. 45Q).

**Figure 4: Cost-Performance Trade-off Analysis**
> A conceptual plot of total cost of ownership versus capture efficiency reveals a clear trade-off. **MEA** sits at a moderate-to-high cost for a proven 90% efficiency. **Advanced amine blends (like KS-1 or MDEA/PZ)** shift the curve down, offering the same 90%+ efficiency at a tangibly lower total cost due to reduced OPEX. **Emerging technologies like ILs or MOFs** currently plot at a very high cost for theoretical high performance, representing a high-risk, high-reward investment. The goal of R&D is to drive the cost of these emerging technologies down to become competitive.

**Market Prediction:** The market will likely bifurcate.
*   **Near-Term (2025-2030):** Commercial deployments will be dominated by **advanced proprietary amine blends** (e.g., MHI KS-series, BASF OASE®) and potentially **enzyme-enhanced systems**, which offer the best balance of performance gains and low technological risk.
*   **Long-Term (2030+):** A breakthrough in cost-effective manufacturing or operational stability for **phase-change solvents or advanced solid sorbents (MOFs)** could disrupt the market, offering a step-change in efficiency that justifies the higher initial investment.

### **Analysis of Recent Patent Literature**

Recent patent activity (2021-2025) is heavily concentrated in two areas:
1.  **Proprietary Multi-Component Amine Blends:** Filings describe increasingly complex aqueous solvents combining tertiary amines (MDEA), amino acid salts (potassium lysinate), and multiple promoters (PZ, MEA, AMP). The claims focus on achieving an optimal balance of high capacity, fast kinetics, superior stability, and low regeneration energy—a "silver bullet" formulation.
2.  **Sustainable and Bio-Derived Solvents:** Patents from companies like Circa Group for their Furatech™ solvents indicate a strategic move to secure intellectual property in the "green" solvent space, leveraging sustainability as a competitive advantage.

This focus shows that while revolutionary concepts are being explored in academia, commercial R&D is centered on creating defensible, high-performance formulations that are evolutionary improvements on existing, well-understood amine chemistry.

## **6. Data Validation and Uncertainty Analysis**

### **Methodology for Data Cross-Referencing**

A validation matrix was constructed to cross-reference Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)—primarily regeneration energy—across different source documents. Data was categorized by its origin: commercial plant data, pilot plant data, lab-scale studies, and techno-economic models. This allowed for an assessment of consistency and an understanding of discrepancies based on scale and experimental conditions.

**Table: Validation Matrix for Regeneration Energy (GJ/tonne CO₂)**

| Solvent System | Source 1 Value & Type | Source 2 Value & Type | Source 3 Value & Type | Discrepancy Analysis & Conclusion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MEA (Benchmark)**| **3.5 - 6.0** <br> (Pilot Plant) | **>3.7** <br> (Economic Analysis) | **~3.87** <br> (Simulation) | **<10% Variation (within range).** The values are consistent. The wide range from the TCM pilot plant reflects real-world operational variability. |
| **MHI KS-1™** | **2.94** <br> (Industrial Data) | **2.94** <br> (Comparison Table) | - | **No Discrepancy.** This value from the Petra Nova plant represents the highest-reliability data for a scaled technology. |
| **CESAR-1 (AMP+PZ)** | **~2.6** (Optimized) <br> (R&D Pilot) | **3.4 - 3.5** (Standard) <br> (Pilot Plant) | **2.6 - 3.5** <br> (Comparison Table) | **>30% Variation.** Discrepancy is explainable. The lower value (`2.6`) is attributed to advanced process configurations (Lean Vapor Compression), while higher values (`3.4-3.5`) represent standard pilot setup. This highlights the critical impact of system integration. |
| **MDEA + PZ** | **3.22 - 3.6** <br> (Lab Data) | **3.22 - 3.6** <br> (Analysis) | **3.22 - 3.6** <br> (Comparison Table) | **No Discrepancy.** The values are highly consistent across sources. |

### **Identified Contradictions in the Literature**

The most significant contradiction identified is not in numerical data but in performance claims versus operational reality.

*   **Design Efficiency vs. Actual Capture:** Commercial plants (Boundary Dam, Petra Nova) are designed for and achieve >90% capture efficiency *during uptime*. However, due to significant operational downtime, their effective long-term average capture rates have been reported to be as low as **55-60%**. This is a fundamental contradiction between a solvent's chemical capability and a project's systemic, real-world performance. It proves that solvent efficiency alone is a poor predictor of project success.
*   **R&D Cost Targets vs. Reality:** The CESAR project targeted a capture cost of **15 €/tonne**, but pilot plant assessments yielded a more realistic **35-55 €/tonne**. This highlights the optimism bias common in early-stage R&D and the "valley of death" in scaling technology, where real-world costs significantly exceed theoretical targets.

### **Summary of Key Research Gaps**

This validation process illuminates several key areas where data is either missing or unreliable, requiring further experimental validation:

1.  **Quantitative Corrosion Data:** The single largest data gap is the lack of quantitative corrosion rates (mm/year) for advanced and novel solvents under realistic flue gas conditions containing impurities. Current data is purely qualitative and insufficient for long-term material selection and maintenance cost projection. **ACTION:** Further research requires long-duration coupon testing in pilot plants.

2.  **Long-Term Stability of Novel Solvents:** For emerging technologies like ILs, Phase-Change Solvents, and DES, there is no reliable data on their degradation pathways, stability, or makeup rates over thousands of operational hours. **ACTION:** Pilot-scale campaigns of at least 1,000 hours are needed to de-risk these technologies for commercial consideration.

3.  **Standardized Performance Reporting:** The lack of a universal standard for reporting KPIs creates uncertainty. **ACTION:** A standardized reporting framework for solvent performance metrics (loading, energy, degradation) is necessary for true "apples-to-apples" comparison across studies.

4.  **Quantifying the Cost of Unreliability:** Techno-economic models rarely account adequately for the financial impact of plant downtime. **ACTION:** Future analysis must incorporate availability and reliability metrics to calculate a more realistic levelized cost of CO₂ captured over a plant's lifetime.
