### **Solvent Profile: Monoethanolamine (MEA)**

Monoethanolamine (MEA) is the benchmark primary amine solvent for post-combustion CO₂ capture. Its widespread use stems from a combination of a high absorption rate, high thermal stability, and low solvent cost. It is considered a commercially mature technology. However, its application is associated with significant challenges, including high regeneration energy demand, solvent degradation, and operational issues like corrosion.

#### **2. CO₂ Absorption and Reaction Kinetics**

MEA reacts with CO₂ via a carbamate formation mechanism, a process characteristic of primary amines. This rapid reaction is a primary advantage of MEA but also dictates its performance limitations.

*   **Absorption Rate:** MEA exhibits a **fast CO₂ absorption rate**, serving as the industry benchmark. Its kinetic performance is superior to tertiary amines like MDEA and sterically hindered amines like AMP. The rate can be further enhanced by blending with activators such as piperazine (PZ).
*   **CO₂ Loading Capacity:** The reaction stoichiometry results in the formation of a stable carbamate, limiting the theoretical capacity to **0.5 moles of CO₂ per mole of MEA**. This is lower than tertiary amines, which can achieve a 1:1 molar ratio.
*   **Reaction Kinetics Data:** While the absorption rate is qualitatively described as high, specific quantitative data were not provided in the source material:
    *   **Second-order reaction rate constant (k₂):** Not specified.
    *   **Activation Energy:** Not specified.

#### **3. Regeneration and Desorption Characteristics**

The high stability of the MEA-carbamate bond makes solvent regeneration the most energy-intensive and costly step in the MEA-based capture process.

*   **Regeneration Energy:** The regeneration energy for a standard MEA process is high. Studies report a baseline reboiler duty of approximately **3.87 GJ per tonne of CO₂** for an optimized system. Blending MEA with other solvents has been shown to significantly reduce this energy penalty:
    *   **MEA/MDEA Blends:** Can reduce energy consumption by over 30%.
    *   **Trio-Amine Blends (e.g., MEA/PZ/1DMA2P):** Achieved energy reductions of 29.4–55.4% compared to standard 5M MEA.
    *   **MEA/1-propanol Blends:** Reported a regeneration heat of 2.40 GJ/t-CO₂, lower than many conventional and biphasic solvents.
*   **Heat of Absorption:** The specific value is not provided, but it is noted as a key property influencing the overall capture cost. The high regeneration energy implies a correspondingly high (exothermic) heat of reaction.
*   **Regeneration Conditions:** Regeneration requires high temperatures, typically achieved with high-pressure steam. The stripper pressure is a critical parameter for process optimization.

#### **4. Operational Considerations**

> While MEA is considered to have "high thermal stability," it is also "susceptible to degradation under process operating conditions." This conflicting assessment highlights a key operational challenge: balancing performance with solvent longevity.

*   **Thermal and Chemical Stability:** MEA's stability is a point of contention. It degrades in the presence of flue gas components such as O₂, SO₂, and NO₂, a process exacerbated by high temperatures in the stripper. Its stability is generally considered lower than that of tertiary and sterically hindered amines.
*   **Solvent Losses:** Significant operational solvent losses are reported, ranging from **0.21 to 3.65 kg of MEA per tonne of CO₂ captured** in pilot facilities. These losses occur through degradation and volatilization.
*   **Corrosion:** MEA solutions are known to be corrosive, presenting a major challenge for equipment integrity. Innovation efforts are focused on developing less corrosive solvent alternatives.

| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Degradation Products**  | MEA degradation forms a mixture of **volatile compounds**, which are emitted with the cleaned flue gas, and **non-volatile hazardous waste** that requires treatment and disposal. **Nitrosamines**, which are recognized carcinogens, are a major byproduct of concern. |
| **Ecotoxicity**         | MEA emissions can lead to a **tenfold increase in freshwater ecotoxicity impacts**. While toxicity potentials have been quantified, the figures are subject to considerable uncertainty.                                                                |
| **Health & Safety Hazards** | - **Direct Contact:** Can result in skin irritation or chemical burns. <br> - **Inhalation:** High vapor concentrations can cause respiratory problems. <br> - **Systemic Risk:** Formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines presents a long-term health risk. |

#### **6. Economic Data**

MEA's economic viability is a balance between its low upfront cost and the high operational costs associated with its use.

*   **Market Price:** A specific price per tonne was not available in the literature. However, MEA is consistently characterized as a **"low-cost" solvent**, which remains one of its most significant advantages for industrial adoption.
*   **Price Trends & Market:** The overall market for CO₂ capture solvents is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.73% between 2024 and 2030. While this indicates growing demand, factors such as tariffs on imported chemicals could impact MEA's procurement cost.
*   **Overall Capture Cost:** Despite high regeneration energy, techno-economic analyses suggest that optimized MEA-based systems can achieve capture costs of approximately **U.S. $37–39 per tonne of CO₂ avoided**, comparable to other solvent systems. The final cost is highly dependent on solvent stability, reaction heat, and absorption rate.
