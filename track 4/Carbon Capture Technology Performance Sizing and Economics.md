| Technology Type | System / Variant | Key Features & Operating Principle | Primary Solvent / Medium | Key Performance Metrics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conventional Column** | Packed Bed Absorber | Gravity-fed liquid solvent flows counter-currently against rising gas over packing material (e.g., Mellapak 250Y, Sulzer DX) to maximize surface area. | 30 wt% MEA | High CO₂ capture rates possible (e.g., 99.72%), but typically large footprint and high energy consumption. |
| **Advanced Column** | Split Flow (SF) | Solvent flow is split, with a portion fed to the upper section of the stripper, reducing reboiler duty. Easier to retrofit. | Amine-based | ~10% reduction in reboiler heat duty (pilot-scale). |
| **Advanced Column** | Heat Integrated Stripper (HIS) | Integrates heat exchange within the stripper column itself. More complex modification, best for new builds. | Amine-based | Reduces cross-flow heat exchanger duty by up to 28%. |

Kgae improved by 130% with intercooled rotors. |
| **Membrane System** | Hollow Fiber Membrane Contactor (HFMC) | Porous hollow fibers separate gas and liquid phases, providing a large, non-dispersive contact area for absorption. | MEA, aqueous absorbents | 81% CO₂ removal at high liquid flow rates. Can achieve high product purity (99.97% N₂). Prone to wetting. |
| **Heat Integration** | Mechanical Vapor Recompression (MVR) | Compresses overhead vapor from the stripper to a higher temperature for reuse as the heat source for the reboiler. | N/A (Process Unit) | Reduces steam demand by up to 25%; contributes to electrification and decarbonization. |
