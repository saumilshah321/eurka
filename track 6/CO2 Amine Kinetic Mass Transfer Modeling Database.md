### **Comprehensive Kinetic and Mass Transfer Database**

This section synthesizes quantitative data from the referenced literature to establish a foundational database for kinetic and mass transfer modeling of CO₂-amine systems. The data is organized into master tables covering reaction kinetics, mass transfer coefficients, enhancement factors, diffusivity, and interfacial area. All units are standardized to SI, and data points are rigorously cited.

### **1. Master Kinetic Parameter Database**

This table compiles the second-order rate constants (`k₂`), activation energies (`Ea`), and derived pre-exponential factors (`A`) for key CO₂-amine reactions. The data provides the basis for reaction rate calculations under various operating conditions.

| Amine System | `k₂` (m³·kmol⁻¹·s⁻¹) | Temperature (K) | `Ea` (kJ·mol⁻¹) | `A` (m³·kmol⁻¹·s⁻¹) | Notes & Mechanism | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MEA** | 3,200 – 10,232 | 288 – 308 | ~41 | ~3.4 x 10¹⁰ (Derived) | Zwitterion mechanism is widely used, though a direct termolecular mechanism is debated. `k₂` values show significant spread in literature. | [51ZW1], [CLGKC] |
| **PZ** | 59,000 – 70,000 | 298 | ~35 | ~8.4 x 10¹⁰ (Derived) | Recognized as a very fast activator. Reaction follows zwitterion mechanism, forming carbamate and dicarbamate. | [29PQY], [51ZW1], [S8ZCP] |
| **PZ** | Up to 116,521 | 313 | ~35 | ~8.4 x 10¹⁰ (Derived) | Rate constant shows strong temperature dependence. | [29PQY], [H47NL] |
| **AMP** | - | - | - | - | Slower than MEA. Kinetics are typically enhanced by blending with activators like PZ or MEA. | [51ZW1], [ZENZ6] |
| **AMP + PZ** | 60,400 – 116,521 | 298 – 313 | - | - | Rate constant refers to the contribution of the PZ component in the blend. | [51ZW1], [H47NL] |
| **DGA** | - | - | - | - | Primary amine; follows a second-order mechanism similar to MEA. | [ARPG3], [51ZW1] |
| **DIPA** | - | - | - | - | Hindered secondary amine; reaction involves a mix of carbamate and bicarbonate formation. | [ARPG3] |
| **MDEA** | - | - | - | - | Tertiary amine; kinetics are slow via base-catalyzed hydration. | [51ZW1] |
| **AEPZ** | - | - | 42.42 | - | Activation energy determined for aqueous 1-(2-aminoethyl) piperazine. | [H47NL] |

*Note: The pre-exponential factor `A` is derived using the Arrhenius equation `k = A * exp(-Ea/RT)` where `k`, `Ea`, and `T` data were available. It represents an order-of-magnitude estimate.*

### **2. Mass Transfer Coefficient Correlations**

Mass transfer coefficients are essential for determining flux across the gas-liquid interface. The following table summarizes the theoretical models and empirical correlations referenced for their calculation.

| Coefficient | Correlation / Model | Key Parameters & Description | Applicable Conditions | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`kL`** | **Surface Renewal Theory** (Danckwerts) | `kL = sqrt(D * s)` where `D` is diffusivity and `s` is the surface renewal rate. | Considered the most realistic model for turbulent systems like packed columns and rotating packed beds (RPBs). | [AESYP], [K3T6N] |
| **`kL`** | **Penetration Theory** (Higbie) | `kL ∝ sqrt(D / θ)` where `θ` is the constant exposure time. | More realistic than film theory for short contact times. | [AESYP], [K3T6N] |
| **`kL`** | **Film Theory** (Whitman) | `kL = D / δ` where `δ` is the stagnant film thickness. | A simplified model, less accurate for turbulent flow but foundational. | [AESYP], [K3T6N] |
| **`kL`, `kG`** | **Onda's Correlation** | Accounts for liquid properties (viscosity, density), packing characteristics (e.g., critical surface tension), and flow rates. | Widely used for predicting partial mass transfer coefficients in random and structured packed columns. Predicts with 0-20% deviation from experimental data. | [AESYP], [RVCJT], [FAW90] |
| **`kLa`** | **Empirical Correlation** | Considers the Hatta number (`Ha`) to characterize the effect of the chemical reaction on the overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient. | Developed for CO₂ absorption into aqueous diethanolamine (DEA) solutions. | [8Q80H] |
| **`kL`, `kG`** | **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** | Data-driven models trained on extensive experimental datasets to predict mass transfer coefficients. | An emerging, more accurate alternative to traditional correlations for large-scale systems. | [AESYP], [RVCJT] |

### **3. Enhancement Factor Compilation**

The enhancement factor (`E`) quantifies the acceleration of mass transfer due to chemical reaction. Its value is primarily a function of the Hatta number (`Ha`).

| Amine System / Condition | Reaction Regime | `Ha` Range | `E` Correlation / Value | Key Insight | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **General** | Slow Reaction | `Ha << 1` | `E ≈ 1` | The reaction occurs in the bulk liquid and does not significantly influence the mass transfer rate. | [AESYP] |
| **General** | Fast, Pseudo-First-Order | `Ha > 3` | `E ≈ Ha` | The reaction occurs entirely within the liquid film, significantly enhancing the concentration gradient. The absorption rate is controlled by diffusion and reaction. | [AESYP], [RVCJT], [8Q80H] |
| **General** | Instantaneous Reaction | `Ha >> E∞` | `E = E∞` | The reaction is limited by the diffusion of the amine reactant to the interface. `E∞` is the infinite enhancement factor. | [AESYP] |
| **CO₂-MEA** | Fast / Intermediate | - | `E = f(Ha, E∞)` | Generalized model by Gaspar and Fosbøl noted as effective. The choice of kinetic model has a significant impact on predicted capture levels. | [RVCJT], [8Q80H] |
| **CO₂-PZ** | Fast / Instantaneous | Very High | Danckwerts' correlation | PZ's exceptionally high rate constant (`k₂`) results in a very large Hatta number, leading to dramatic enhancement in the CO₂ absorption rate. | [29PQY], [S8ZCP] |
| **Catalytic** | - | - | `E_enhancement` up to 18x | In MDEA, the biocatalyst Carbonic Anhydrase (CA) can improve performance by up to 18 times. In MEA, SiO₂ nanoparticles provided up to 23% enhancement. | [29PQY], [H47NL] |

### **4. Diffusivity Database**

Diffusion coefficients of CO₂ and amines are critical inputs for mass transfer calculations (`kL ∝ D^0.5`). The provided literature discusses factors influencing diffusivity but does not specify empirical correlations like Wilke-Chang or the N₂O analogy.

| Species | Solvent System | Dependency / Effect | Mechanism / Note | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CO₂, Amine** | Aqueous Amines | **Increases** with Temperature | Higher thermal energy increases molecular mobility. | [AESYP] |
| **CO₂, Amine** | Aqueous Amines | **Decreases** with Viscosity | `D ∝ 1/μ`. Higher viscosity hinders molecular movement. Viscosity increases with amine concentration and CO₂ loading. | [AESYP] |
| **CO₂** | Nanofluids (e.g., K₂CO₃ + TiO₂) | **Increased** by 1.5x | Brownian motion of nanoparticles induces micro-convection, disrupting the boundary layer. Optimal nanoparticle concentration is critical. | [H47NL] |
| **CO₂** | Nanofluids | Enhanced by "Shuttle Effect" | Mobile nanoparticles adsorb CO₂ at the interface and transport it into the bulk liquid, enhancing transport beyond molecular diffusion. | [29PQY], [AESYP] |

> **Analyst Note:** While specific correlations for diffusivity were requested, they were not present in the reference documents. The table above summarizes the qualitative relationships and observed quantitative effects on diffusivity as reported in the literature. For predictive modeling, standard correlations such as Wilke-Chang would need to be sourced from foundational chemical engineering literature.

### **5. Interfacial Area Correlations**

The specific interfacial area (`a`) is a critical hydrodynamic parameter for packed columns, representing the effective area for mass transfer per unit volume.

| Correlation / Model | Key Parameters | Packing Type | Applicability & Notes | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Onda's Correlation** | Liquid properties (viscosity, surface tension), packing characteristics (material, size, critical surface tension), gas and liquid flow rates. | Random and Structured Packings | A widely used semi-empirical model for predicting wetted interfacial area. Can be adapted for Rotating Packed Beds (RPBs) by substituting gravity with centrifugal acceleration. | [AESYP], [RVCJT], [FAW90] |
| **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** | Trained on experimental data including flow rates, fluid properties, and packing geometry. | Random and Structured Packings | A modern, data-driven approach that can offer higher accuracy than traditional empirical correlations, especially for large-scale systems where uncertainties are high. | [AESYP], [RVCJT] |
| **Hydrodynamic Factors** | Liquid holdup (`hL`), liquid flow rate, wetting efficiency, fluid contact angle. | General Packed Columns | `a` is not solely a function of packing geometry but is strongly influenced by operational hydrodynamics. Increasing liquid flow generally increases `a` up to the flooding point. | [AESYP], [RVCJT] |
