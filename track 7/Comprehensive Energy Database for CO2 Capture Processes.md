# **Comprehensive Energy Database for CO₂ Capture Processes**

This document serves as a centralized repository of critical energy and economic data for CO₂ capture technologies, synthesized from recent literature (post-2019). It is structured to provide a quantitative foundation for techno-economic analysis, process design, and strategic decision-making in the field of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS). The database is organized into six key sections, each focusing on a distinct aspect of process performance and optimization.

## **1. Energy Consumption Benchmarks**

### **1.1. Context and Inquiry**

A fundamental step in evaluating and improving CO₂ capture technologies is to establish clear performance benchmarks. The primary energy consumer in conventional solvent-based absorption is the thermal energy required for solvent regeneration, commonly referred to as the **specific reboiler duty (SRD)**. However, a holistic assessment must also account for electrical energy consumed by pumps, compressors, and blowers. Total Equivalent Work provides a thermodynamic basis for comparing processes by converting thermal energy into an equivalent work potential.

The central questions addressed in this section are:
- What are the typical energy consumption values for benchmark technologies like MEA scrubbing?
- How do key process parameters, such as CO₂ concentration and capture rate, influence energy requirements?
- What proportion of total energy is attributed to thermal versus electrical demands?

The following matrix compiles specific energy consumption data from various studies to benchmark the performance of different CO₂ capture configurations.

### **1.2. Energy Consumption Benchmark Matrix**

**Table 1: Energy Consumption Benchmark Matrix**

### **1.3. Analysis and Key Insights**

The data in Table 1 reaffirms that the **specific reboiler duty remains the single largest energy consumer** in amine-based CO₂ capture, typically hovering around 4.0 GJ/tCO₂ for benchmark MEA processes and accounting for 70-80% of the total energy input.

*   **Impact of Process Intensification:** Advanced stripper configurations, such as the flash stripper mentioned in `A7KWE`, demonstrate a significant potential to lower the SRD by over 25%. This highlights that mechanical and process design innovations are as crucial as solvent development.
*   **Influence of CO₂ Concentration:** The energy penalty of capture is highly sensitive to the CO₂ concentration in the source gas. As shown in `A7KWE`, moving to higher-concentration streams (e.g., from power to industrial sources) can reduce thermal energy costs by nearly 25%, a critical factor for economic feasibility.
*   **Role of Novel Solvents:** The development of hybrid and biphasic solvents (`A7KWE`) presents a promising pathway to reduce regeneration energy. The 26% reduction in heat capacity for a novel hybrid solvent suggests that fundamental chemistry improvements can directly translate to lower operating costs.

In conclusion, while a standard MEA process provides a useful baseline, significant deviations in energy performance are observed based on process configuration, operating conditions, and solvent chemistry. Future analyses must carefully specify these parameters to enable meaningful comparisons.
